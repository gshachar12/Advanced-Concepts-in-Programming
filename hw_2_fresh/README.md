# Tank Battle Game

## Overview

Tank Battle is a console-based strategy game where players control tanks on a 2D grid-based battlefield. The game implements modern C++ practices and various design patterns to create an immersive and challenging gameplay experience.

## Game Description

In Tank Battle, each player controls one or more tanks on a grid-based map. Players can move their tanks, rotate them in different directions, and fire shells at opponents. The goal is to destroy all enemy tanks while protecting your own.

### Game Elements

- **Tanks**: Player-controlled units that can move, rotate, and fire shells
- **Walls**: Obstacles that block movement and shells 
- **Weak Walls**: Barriers that can be destroyed after one hit from a shell (represented by '=' symbol)
- **Mines**: Explosive objects that damage tanks
- **Shells**: Projectiles fired by tanks that damage other tanks, walls, or mines

## Building the Game

To build the game, simply run:

```bash
make
```

This will compile the game and generate the `tanks_game` executable.

## Running the Game

To play the game, run:

```bash
./tanks_game inputs/<map_file>
```

Where `<map_file>` is one of the provided map files in the `inputs/` directory.

### Maps

The game includes several map files:
- `input1.txt` - Simple map with minimal obstacles
- `input2.txt` - Tactical map with multiple tanks per player
- `input3.txt` - Close combat map
- `input4.txt` - Maze challenge
- `input5.txt` - Battlefield with mines
- `input_weak_wall.txt` - Test map for weak walls
- `wall_transformation_test.txt` - Test map for wall transformation visualization

### Game Controls

The game is AI-controlled, so no user input is required during gameplay. The tanks will move and act according to their programming.

## Testing the Wall Transformation Feature

The game features a wall system where:
1. Regular walls (represented by '#') take 2 hits to destroy
2. After the first hit, regular walls transform into weak walls (represented by '=')
3. Weak walls take only 1 hit to destroy
4. In visual mode, regular walls display as ðŸŸ© and weak walls (and damaged regular walls) display as ðŸ§±

### Running the Tests

To verify this functionality, run our simple test script:

```bash
./test_wall_feature.sh
```

This script will:
1. Build all wall tests
2. Run the simple wall test and save the output to logs
3. Run the wall collision test and save the output to logs
4. Run the wall boundary test and save the output to logs
5. Build the main game
6. Run the game with the wall test map

You can also run the tests manually:

```bash
# Build and run individual tests
make test_wall            # Runs the basic wall test
make test_wall_collision  # Runs the wall collision test  
make test_wall_boundary   # Runs the wall boundary test
make test_all             # Runs all tests

# Run the game with the wall test map
./tanks_game -g inputs/wall_test.txt
```

### Available Tests

The project includes multiple test files for comprehensive wall behavior testing:

- **wall_test.cpp**: Basic tests for wall transformation and behavior
- **wall_collision_test.cpp**: Tests for collision handling with walls
- **wall_boundary_test.cpp**: Tests for wall behavior at boundaries and edge cases

### Test Results

The test results are saved in the logs directory:
- `logs/wall_test.log` - Results of the simple wall test
- `logs/wall_collision_test.log` - Results of the wall collision test
- `logs/wall_boundary_test.log` - Results of the wall boundary test

### Visual Verification

To visually verify the wall transformation feature:

1. Run the game with the test map: `./tanks_game -g inputs/wall_transformation_test.txt`
2. Shoot at a wall (the AI will do this automatically)
3. Observe the wall changing from ðŸŸ© to ðŸ§± after one hit

## Game Rules

1. Each tank can move forward, rotate, or fire a shell on its turn
2. Shells travel in the direction they are fired until they hit something
3. When a shell hits a wall, the wall is weakened
4. Regular walls require two hits to destroy
5. Weak walls (marked with '=') require only one hit to destroy
6. When a tank is hit by a shell, it is destroyed
7. The game ends when all tanks of one player are destroyed, or when the maximum number of steps is reached

## File Structure

- `src/` - Source code files
  - `gameManager/` - Game management and core functionality
  - `algorithms/` - Tank AI algorithms
- `include/` - Header files
- `inputs/` - Game map files
- `outputs/` - Output files from game runs
- `logs/` - Log files including error messages
- `build/` - Compiled objects and binaries

## Logging

The game generates logs in the `logs/` directory:
- `log.txt` - General game logs
- `error.txt` - Error messages
- `input_error.txt` - Input parsing errors

## Testing

To run the test suite:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

## Visual Mode

For a better visual experience, you can run the game with the `-g` flag:

```bash
./tanks_game -g inputs/<map_file>
```

This will display the game with emojis representing different game elements:
- ðŸŸ© - Wall
- ðŸ§± - Weak Wall
- ðŸ’£ - Mine
- ðŸš€ - Shell
- ðŸ’¥ - Explosion
- â¬œ - Empty space

## Creating Custom Maps

You can create your own maps as text files with the following format:

```
Description Line
MaxSteps=<number>
NumShells=<number>
Rows=<number>
Cols=<number>
###############
#1           #
#            #
#    ===     #
#    ===     #
#            #
#           2#
###############
```

Where:
- `#` represents walls
- `=` represents weak walls
- `@` represents mines
- `1` represents player 1 tanks
- `2` represents player 2 tanks
- Spaces represent empty cells
